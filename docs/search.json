You can add a bit about yourself, but no identifying information. Saying Intro to Data Science is okay, but you shouldn’t mention Smith College.\nOne page per data piece.\nAn about page so people can contact you to hire you (Add a different photo to the fake contact page). You can not add identifying info here.\n\nYou will make use of the nav bar.\nYour website should look professional use any of the skills from 192 or 100. Consider headers and links.\nYour website must be pushed to github and turned on and working. So please test it. When you are done submit the link to your site to the forum on moodle."

Use the made up contact information for your contact. Don’t even say Smith College. Remember even if you pages are public your repos are private.\nAfter your website is graded, I’ll turn them off. If you would like you can turn them on and do whatever you want with it. Keep in mind when you graduate from Smith you’ll lose your Smith email and likely your repo/website. But you’ll still have them as files on your computer.\nThis is meant to be a simple skill that students last semester wished they knew how to do. It should not be very very time consuming. Make something that meet requirements then move on. You can perfect it over the summer."
